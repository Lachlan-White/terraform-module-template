# Changelog

This Changelog should be used to document the differences between releases of your modules versions.

Whilst manually updating this file is possible for every change and release, it is much better to use the commit history and automatically populate this file.

The use of the [semantic-release-bot](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) is a great way to take the pain out of doing this.
