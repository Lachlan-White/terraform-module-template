/*

This file should be deleted if it isn't used or there isn't a complex example for the module.

The complex example should again use all the required prerequisite resources / modules in order to deploy itself. However, this example should use all possible variables available to provide examples and context on how to consume the most advanced version of this module. You may find that your complex example sometimes has more resource / module prerequisites than the basic example.
